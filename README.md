> Note: This is my side project, so I'm not overly focused on it, but I am aiming to complete it.

## Why This Project?
Creating email templates can be a tedious and time-consuming task, especially for those without extensive design or coding experience. This project was inspired by the need to simplify and automate the email creation process, allowing users to focus more on the content and less on the formatting and design.

## Project Idea Source
The idea for this tool came from a blog post titled "[Creating e-mail templates is painful, isn't it?](https://peerlist.io/blog/weekly-spotlight/week-20)" while participating in the [AI-Hackathon](https://peerlist.io/hackathons/peerlist-roadmap-hackathon) by [Peerlist](https://github.com/PeerlistHQ) x [Roadmap.sh](https://github.com/roadmapsh). The post highlighted the challenges and frustrations many people face when designing emails. This sparked the idea to create a tool that uses AI to alleviate these pains, making email template creation quick, easy, and accessible to everyone.
